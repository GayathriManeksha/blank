SO the user can use some "Chat to Make a Deal" option to Text
On clicking that option a CreateRoom signal is send , which creates a room 
The createRoom creates a room in the socket with id of the Chat Model ( This model records all the messages in the room)
Both parties can send messages in the room , or create a "Book" option

If accepted an appointment is created
